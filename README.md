# Send-Secure-Message    
Script for the interactive creation of an encrypted message or file to me.    
Written in Bash, it is currently compatable with Linux and OSX.    
I know its a bit silly given the purpose of the script...    
But just for giggles I've included a GPG signature of the script.
